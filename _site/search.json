    "text": "Visual Analytics Project Proposal\nMapping the Rise of Sailor Shift and the Ripple of Oceanus Folk:\nA Visual Analytics Journey\nMotivation\nOceanus Folk began as a niche genre tied to the cultural identity of the small island nation of Oceanus. Its unexpected global emergence—catalyzed by Sailor Shift’s meteoric career—offers a rare opportunity to examine the interplay between individual stardom, genre influence, and collaborative networks in music. Understanding how a genre spreads and evolves offers insight not only into musical trends but also into networked cultural transmission.\nProblem Statement\nWe aim to explore how Oceanus Folk evolved from a local genre into a global phenomenon, focusing particularly on Sailor Shift’s role. We investigate:\n\nHow Sailor’s collaborations and influence shaped the genre.\nThe genre’s influence on others over time.\nThe defining traits of rising stars and how to predict future Oceanus Folk influencers.\n\nRelated Work\nWe draw on network analysis techniques as implemented in the tidygraph and ggraph frameworks , and structure our problem understanding through HDAV (Hypothesis-Driven Approach for VAST) . We incorporate lessons on visual storytelling and exploratory workflows using tools developed in past VAST challenges ."
