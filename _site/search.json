    "text": "Visual Analytics Project Proposal\nMapping the Rise of Sailor Shift and the Ripple of Oceanus Folk:\nA Visual Analytics Journey\nMotivation\nOceanus Folk began as a niche genre tied to the cultural identity of the small island nation of Oceanus. Its unexpected global emergence—catalyzed by Sailor Shift’s meteoric career—offers a rare opportunity to examine the interplay between individual stardom, genre influence, and collaborative networks in music. Understanding how a genre spreads and evolves offers insight not only into musical trends but also into networked cultural transmission."
