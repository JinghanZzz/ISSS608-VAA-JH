    "text": "Visual Analytics Project Proposal\nMapping the Rise of Sailor Shift and the Ripple of Oceanus Folk:\nA Visual Analytics Journey\nMotivation\nOceanus Folk began as a niche genre tied to the cultural identity of the small island nation of Oceanus. Its unexpected global emergence—catalyzed by Sailor Shift’s meteoric career—offers a rare opportunity to examine the interplay between individual stardom, genre influence, and collaborative networks in music. Understanding how a genre spreads and evolves offers insight not only into musical trends but also into networked cultural transmission.\nProblem Statement\nWe aim to explore how Oceanus Folk evolved from a local genre into a global phenomenon, focusing particularly on Sailor Shift’s role. We investigate:\n\nHow Sailor’s collaborations and influence shaped the genre.\nThe genre’s influence on others over time.\nThe defining traits of rising stars and how to predict future Oceanus Folk influencers.\n\nRelated Work\nWe draw on network analysis techniques as implemented in the tidygraph and ggraph frameworks , and structure our problem understanding through HDAV (Hypothesis-Driven Approach for VAST) . We incorporate lessons on visual storytelling and exploratory workflows using tools developed in past VAST challenges .\nApproach\nOur project will follow these key modules, each owned by a team member:\nNetwork Construction:\n\nConvert JSON knowledge graph (MC1_graph.json) into tbl_graph.\nIdentify node types (songs, people, albums), edges (influence, collaboration), and their attributes (release dates, genres).\n\nCareer Profiling:\n\nTrace Sailor Shift’s career arc.\nUse time-based visualizations (timelines, slopegraphs) to show genre transitions and viral milestones.\nInfluence Diffusion:\nConstruct subgraphs of Oceanus Folk works and their downstream influence.\nUse edge filtering to isolate influence types: coverof, interpolatesfrom, etc.\nCreate genre-level Sankey diagrams and time-faceted network graphs to assess diffusion trends.\nRising Star Detection:\nCalculate centrality, community clustering, and influence scores.\nCompare Sailor’s early career path with other artists using slopegraphs and sparkline summaries.\nBuild a Shiny module to predict likely future Oceanus Folk influences."
