**Visual Analytics Project Proposal**

**Mapping the Rise of Sailor Shift and the Ripple of Oceanus Folk:**

**A Visual Analytics Journey**

**Motivation**

Oceanus Folk began as a niche genre tied to the cultural identity of the small island nation of Oceanus. Its unexpected global emergence—catalyzed by Sailor Shift’s meteoric career—offers a rare opportunity to examine the interplay between individual stardom, genre influence, and collaborative networks in music. Understanding how a genre spreads and evolves offers insight not only into musical trends but also into networked cultural transmission.

**Problem Statement**

We aim to explore how Oceanus Folk evolved from a local genre into a global phenomenon, focusing particularly on Sailor Shift's role. We investigate:

-   How Sailor's collaborations and influence shaped the genre.

-    The genre's influence on others over time.

-   The defining traits of rising stars and how to predict future Oceanus Folk influencers.
