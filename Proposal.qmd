**Visual Analytics Project Proposal**

**Mapping the Rise of Sailor Shift and the Ripple of Oceanus Folk:**

**A Visual Analytics Journey**

**Motivation**

Oceanus Folk began as a niche genre tied to the cultural identity of the small island nation of Oceanus. Its unexpected global emergence—catalyzed by Sailor Shift’s meteoric career—offers a rare opportunity to examine the interplay between individual stardom, genre influence, and collaborative networks in music. Understanding how a genre spreads and evolves offers insight not only into musical trends but also into networked cultural transmission.

**Problem Statement**

We aim to explore how Oceanus Folk evolved from a local genre into a global phenomenon, focusing particularly on Sailor Shift's role. We investigate:

-   How Sailor's collaborations and influence shaped the genre.

-   The genre's influence on others over time.

-   The defining traits of rising stars and how to predict future Oceanus Folk influencers.

**Related Work**

We draw on network analysis techniques as implemented in the tidygraph and ggraph frameworks , and structure our problem understanding through HDAV (Hypothesis-Driven Approach for VAST) . We incorporate lessons on visual storytelling and exploratory workflows using tools developed in past VAST challenges .

**Approach**

Our project will follow these key modules, each owned by a team member:

**Network Construction**:

-   Convert JSON knowledge graph (MC1_graph.json) into tbl_graph.

-   Identify node types (songs, people, albums), edges (influence, collaboration), and their attributes (release dates, genres).

**Career Profiling**:

-   Trace Sailor Shift’s career arc.

-   Use time-based visualizations (timelines, slopegraphs) to show genre transitions and viral milestones.

    **Influence Diffusion**:

-   Construct subgraphs of Oceanus Folk works and their downstream influence.

-   Use edge filtering to isolate influence types: coverof, interpolatesfrom, etc.

-   Create genre-level Sankey diagrams and time-faceted network graphs to assess diffusion trends.

    **Rising Star Detection**:

-   Calculate centrality, community clustering, and influence scores.

-   Compare Sailor’s early career path with other artists using slopegraphs and sparkline summaries.

-   Build a Shiny module to predict likely future Oceanus Folk influences.
