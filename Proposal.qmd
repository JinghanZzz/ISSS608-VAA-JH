**Visual Analytics Project Proposal**

**Mapping the Rise of Sailor Shift and the Ripple of Oceanus Folk:**

**A Visual Analytics Journey**

**Motivation**

Oceanus Folk began as a niche genre tied to the cultural identity of the small island nation of Oceanus. Its unexpected global emergence—catalyzed by Sailor Shift’s meteoric career—offers a rare opportunity to examine the interplay between individual stardom, genre influence, and collaborative networks in music. Understanding how a genre spreads and evolves offers insight not only into musical trends but also into networked cultural transmission.
